// The main idea of the solution is â€” While traversing Binary Search Tree
// from top to bottom, the first node n we encounter with value between
// n1 and n2, i.e., n1 < n < n2 is the Lowest or Least Common Ancestor(LCA)
// of n1 and n2 (where n1 < n2). So just traverse the BST in pre-order,
// if you find a node with value in between n1 and n2 then n is the LCA,
// if it's value is greater than both n1 and n2 then our LCA lies on left
// side of the node, if it's value is smaller than both n1 and n2 then LCA
// lies on right side.
